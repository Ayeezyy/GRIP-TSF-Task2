# Decision Tree Task

This repository contains the code and documentation for the decision tree task completed during my internship at Sparks Foundation.

## Overview

The task involved building a decision tree model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal was to create a model that could accurately classify iris flowers into different species using their measurements.

## Files Included

- **Task-2_Decision_Tree.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using a decision tree classifier.
- **iris.csv**: CSV file containing the iris dataset used for training and testing the decision tree model.

## Dataset

The dataset `iris.csv` contains measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and their corresponding species labels. This dataset was used to train and test the decision tree classifier.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the decision tree classifier in accurately classifying iris flower species.

## Conclusion

The decision tree classifier demonstrated a high level of accuracy in classifying iris flowers into different species based on their measurements. Further analysis and optimization of the model can be explored to enhance its performance and generalizability.
